Geocoding data within the context of a Rails application can be tricky. There
are a plethora of decisions to be made before the first line of code is written:
*What tools should we use? Where should geocoding business logic live? What's the
best way to write a test for this?* And after the feature has been built, *Is it
fast enough?*

Geocoding on Rails is a resource for developers seeking an object-oriented,
test-driven approach to integrating geocoding functionality within Rails
applications. It is divided into three sections:

* An overview of recommended tools and strategies for working with geocoded data
* Techniques for testing and implementing features, with code samples
* A discussion of performance improvement techniques

**Example application**

This book comes with a bundled example application.
