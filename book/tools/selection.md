## Selecting the Proper Tools

When choosing the tools with which you will geocode, first ask yourself how
accurate your data needs to be. If you are plotting physical locations on a
map, geocoding an address is key. If you are performing a fuzzy search of
results based on just a postal code, you may not need to retrieve data from an
external service and instead query against data local to your application.

Once you have determined how accurate the data needs to be, determine your
budget and request restrictions. Google provides geocoding APIs but restricts
requests to a few thousand a day. Other providers may have different
restrictions. If you're planning on a lot of traffic, paid options exist but
may be priced out of budget.
