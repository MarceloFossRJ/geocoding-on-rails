# Introduction

> "The world is a beautiful book, but it's not much use if you donâ€™t know how to
read." -- Carlo Goldoni, *Pamela*

The human desire to acquire knowledge of the natural world has produced
countless systems for aggregating, manipulating, and representing geospatial
information. In recent years--now that we're all generally agreed on the
shape of the Earth--it has also produced a lot of software.

Working with geocoded data within the context of a web application can be
tricky. While the availability of free and open-source libraries has greatly
simplified the challenges of accurately geocoding data and performing meaningful
analysis, there are still a plethora of decisions to be made before the
first line of code is written: *What tools should we use? Where should the
business logic live? What's the best way to write a test for this?* And after
the feature has been built, *Is it fast enough?*

*Geocoding on Rails* is a resource for developers seeking an object-oriented,
test-driven approach to working with geocoded data within Rails
applications. It is divided into four sections:

1. **Strategies** for selecting an external geocoding service
1. **Application Development** approaches for organizing your code as you're
   developing features
1. **Improving Application Performance** with caching and other techniques
1. **Testing** techniques for your server- and client-side code

The code samples in this book come from commits in the [bundled example
application][geocoding-on-rails-example-app-github]. The example application
is a Rails app which lets users search for Starbucks locations nearby. Take a
look at the [README][geocoding-on-rails-example-app-readme] for instructions
on setting it up.

This sample contains a few hand-picked sections covering various aspects of
application development and performance improvements: plotting points on a
map, geocoding browser requests from the server and caching results from
external requests. Because these sections are pulled directly from the book,
you're able to get a sense for the content, style, and delivery of the
product.

## Plot Points on a Map

At this point, all the data has been geocoded; the next step is to display this
information by rendering each location on a map. This allows users to understand
spatial relationships between the data points.

We'll be using the [Google Maps JavaScript API][google-maps-api] to display a
map and plot a marker for each location. Because requests to the Google Maps
API are made on the client side, there are no changes to the controller or
model.

### Changes to the View

Before jumping into querying the maps API, we make some decisions about
how we're going to organize our client-side scripts.

First, we create a namespace for our application:

```coffee
# app/assets/javascripts/base.coffee
@ExampleApp = {}
```

Then we create a `javascript.html.erb` partial which will be rendered in the
application layout body:

```rhtml
# app/views/application/_javascript.html.erb
<%= javascript_include_tag "application", "data-turbolinks-track" => true %>
<%= yield :javascript %>
```

```rhtml
# app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <%= yield %>
  </div>

  <%= render 'javascript' %>
</body>
```

With our initial setup complete, we now create some CoffeeScript classes to
handle interactions with the maps API. We begin by creating a `Mapper` to
display the map on the page with markers placed at the correct coordinates:

```coffee
# app/assets/javascripts/mapper.coffee
class @ExampleApp.Mapper
  constructor: (cssSelector) ->
    @cssSelector = cssSelector
    @map = null
    @bounds = new ExampleApp.MapBounds

  addCoordinates: (latitude, longitude) ->
    if !_.isEmpty(latitude) and !_.isEmpty(longitude)
      @bounds.add(latitude, longitude)

  render: =>
    @map = new ExampleApp.Map(@cssSelector, @bounds)
    @map.build()
```

Next we create a `MapBounds` class which provides a simple interface for
interacting with Google's representation of coordinates and bounds:

```coffee
# app/assets/javascripts/map_bounds.coffee
class @ExampleApp.MapBounds
  constructor: ->
    @googleLatLngBounds = new google.maps.LatLngBounds()
    @latLngs = []

  add: (latitude, longitude) ->
    latLng = new google.maps.LatLng(latitude, longitude)
    @googleLatLngBounds.extend(latLng)
    @latLngs.push(latLng)

  getCenter: ->
    @googleLatLngBounds.getCenter()
```

We also create a `Map` class to provide a simple interface to the Google Maps
JavaScript API for rendering a responsive map:

```coffee
# app/assets/javascripts/map.coffee
class @ExampleApp.Map
  constructor: (cssSelector, bounds) ->
    @googleMap = new google.maps.Map($(cssSelector)[0], @_mapOptions())
    @bounds = bounds

    $(window).on 'resize', =>
      google.maps.event.trigger(@googleMap, 'resize')
      @_updateCenter()

  build: ->
    @_updateCenter()
    @_plotCoordinates()

  _updateCenter: ->
    @googleMap.fitBounds @bounds.googleLatLngBounds
    @googleMap.setCenter @bounds.getCenter()

  _plotCoordinates: ->
    for latLng in @bounds.latLngs
      new google.maps.Marker(position: latLng, map: @googleMap)

  _mapOptions: ->
    zoom: 13
    mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.SATELLITE
```

Finally, we add a function in the view which instantiates a `Mapper` and calls
`addCoordinates()` and `render()` to display a map and plot each location on
page load. We also add a `map` element to the DOM:

```rhtml
# app/views/locations/index.html.erb
<div id="map" style="height: 400px;"></div>

<ul class="locations">
  <% @locations.each do |location| %>
    <%= render location %>
  <% end %>
</ul>

<% content_for :javascript do %>
  <script type="text/javascript"
    src="//maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false"></script>

  <%= javascript_tag do %>
    $(function() {
      var mapper = new ExampleApp.Mapper('#map');

      $('[data-latitude]').each(function(index, element) {
        mapper.addCoordinates(
          $(element).attr('data-latitude'),
          $(element).attr('data-longitude')
        );
      });

      mapper.render();
    });
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

```rhtml
# app/views/locations/_location.html.erb
<%= content_tag_for :li, location,
  data: { latitude: location.latitude, longitude: location.longitude } do %>
  <header>
    <h1 data-role="name"><%= location.name %></h1>
    <% if location.respond_to?(:distance) %>
      <h2 data-role="distance"><%= location.distance.round(1) %> mi</h2>
    <% end %>
  </header>
  <section>
    <section class="location-info">
      <p data-role="address"><%= location.address %></p><br>
      <p data-role="phone-number">
        <%= link_to location.phone_number, "tel:#{location.phone_number}" %>
      </p>
    </section>
  </section>
<% end %>
```

## Geocode Browser Requests on the Server Side

Once data in the application is searchable based on values other than postal
codes, there are a number of usability improvements that can be made; one is
pre-populating the search field with a guess at the city and state of the
user.

### Changes to the Controller and View

The [geocoder][geocoder-github] gem extends the `request` object within Rails
controllers with a new method, `#location`, which exposes information about
both city and state. By creating a new class, `RequestGeocodingGatherer`, to
handle calculating city and state, we're able to keep this logic out of the
controller and have small classes, each with their own responsibility:

```ruby
# app/models/request_geocoding_gatherer.rb
class RequestGeocodingGatherer
  def initialize(request)
    @request = request
  end

  def current_location
    if city && state
      [city, state].join ', '
    else
      ''
    end
  end

  private

  delegate :city, :state, to: :location
  delegate :location, to: :@request
end
```

Within the controller, we specify a `class_attribute
:request_geocoding_gatherer` and assign it to our new class to retrieve the
current location string from the `request`:

```ruby
# app/controllers/locations_controller.rb
class LocationsController < ApplicationController
  class_attribute :request_geocoding_gatherer
  self.request_geocoding_gatherer = RequestGeocodingGatherer

  def index
    @current_location_by_ip = geocoded_request_information.current_location
    @locations = if search_value.present?
                   Location.near(search_value)
                 else
                   Location.all
                 end
  end

  private

  def search_value
    params[:search] && params[:search][:value]
  end

  def geocoded_request_information
    request_geocoding_gatherer.new(request)
  end
end
```

In the view, we set the search field's placeholder to `@current_location_by_ip`:

```rhtml
# app/views/locations/index.html.erb
<%= form_for :search, method: :get, url: root_path do |form| %>
  <%= form.label :value, 'Search by Location' %>
  <%= form.text_field :value, placeholder: @current_location_by_ip %>
  <%= form.submit 'Search' %>
<% end %>
```

### Testing

\part{Improving Application Performance}

## Cache Results from External Requests

The [geocoder][geocoder-github] gem provides support for caching responses
from external geocoding services by URL. When your application attempts to
geocode a location that has already been geocoded, the gem will return the
cached response for the request URL.

Start by defining a class to encapsulate the cache. In this example, we're
using Memcache (because it works immediately with `Rails.cache`), but Redis is
also supported. [Geocoder][geocoder-github] requires that the cache object
implement the following four methods:

1. `CacheClassName#[](key)`
2. `CacheClassName#[]=(key, value)`
3. `CacheClassName#del(key)`
4. `CacheClassName#keys`

The first three methods are invoked when setting, retrieving and deleting
key-value pairs. The last method, `CacheClassName#keys`, is invoked only when
clearing out the cache; in this implementation, it returns an empty array:

```ruby
# app/models/geocoder_cache.rb
class GeocoderCache
  CACHE_KEY = 'geocoder_cache'

  def initialize(store = Rails.cache)
    @store = store
  end

  def []=(key, value)
    if value.nil?
      del key
    else
      write_to_store key, value
    end
  end

  def [](key)
    read_from_store key
  end

  def keys
    []
  end

  def del(key)
    store.delete full_key(key)
  end

  private

  def full_key(key)
    [CACHE_KEY, key].join(' ').parameterize
  end

  def read_from_store(key)
    store.read full_key(key)
  end

  def store
    @store
  end

  def write_to_store(key, value)
    store.write full_key(key), value
  end
end
```

Next, configure the cache store in an initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/geocoder.rb
Geocoder.configure(cache: GeocoderCache.new)
```

Finally, ensure that you configure the `cache_store` setting within your Rails
application correctly in your test environment:

```ruby
# config/environments/test.rb
config.cache_store = :null_store
```

This disallows cached values within your test environment, which means you can
be confident that any tests you write don't rely inadvertently on state from
other tests.
